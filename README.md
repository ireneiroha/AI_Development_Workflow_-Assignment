📊 Use Case Overview
Scenario: Predicting patient readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge.
We applied AI techniques to design a pipeline that ingests patient data, applies preprocessing, builds a predictive model, and evaluates performance while adhering to ethical and legal constraints (e.g., HIPAA).
