# 🏥 AI Development Workflow for Hospital Readmission

## 📘 Course: AI for Software Engineering 

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to develop a predictive model for hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we will analyze patient data to identify factors contributing to readmissions and provide actionable insights for healthcare providers.

## 📊 Use Case Overview

Scenario: Predicting patient readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge. We will apply AI techniques to design a pipeline that ingests patient data, applies preprocessing, builds a predictive model, and evaluates performance while adhering to ethical and legal constraints (e.g., HIPAA).
