Reflection
What was the most challenging part of the workflow? Why?

The most challenging part was ensuring fairness and ethical integrity in the model’s predictions. Healthcare involves high-stakes decisions, and balancing performance with patient safety, privacy, and equity requires deep reflection and responsible design. Mitigating bias, aligning with regulations, and building trust through interpretability are not straightforward tasks—they demand both technical solutions and human judgment.

How would you improve your approach with more time/resources?

With more time and resources, I would:

Conduct deeper bias impact analyses using fairness evaluation metrics

Collaborate with domain experts (clinicians, ethicists)

Incorporate tools like LIME/SHAP for explainability

Use privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy or federated learning for sensitive data
